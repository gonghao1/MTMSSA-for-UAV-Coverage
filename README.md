# MTMSSA-for-UAV-Coverage
Multitasking based Multi-objective Salp Swarm Algorithm (MTMMA) for UAV visual coverage  

Currently, we provide codes for the MTMSSA optimization framework, designed to minimize UAV energy consumption and reduce the time required for multi-UAV visual coverage.

mtmssa_total.m and mtmssa_test_new_update2.m are the two main functions, which can provide the scheme of UAV energy and time minimization for multi-UAV visual coverage.

You can also adjust the parameters in the codes to get the minimum UAV energy consumption and minimum task fulfillment time in any case of multi-UAV 3-D terrestrial region visual coverage.

If our paper is accepted, we will open source all the codes.
